# Hi there, I'm Nicolas Jeanmenne üëã

I am currently doing a Master's degree in computer science at [University of Louvain](https://github.com/uclouvain) with 
particular interests for cloud computing, (high speed) networking and cybersecurity. Moreover, I am a big fan of free and
open-source software and a member of [Louvain-li-Nux](https://louvainlinux.org).
