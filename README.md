### Hi there, I'm Nicolas Jeanmenne 👋

I am currently a bachelor student in computer science at [University of Louvain](https://github.com/uclouvain) with 
particular interests for networking, embedded systems and cloud computing. I am also a proudly advocate of free and 
open-source software and a member of [Louvain-li-Nux](https://louvainlinux.org).

#### About me

- 💻 I'm working on [buzzer system](https://github.com/nicojmn/buzzer)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how [urllib3](https://github.com/nicojmn/urllib3) works. My aim is to add [MPTCP](https://www.multipath-tcp.org/) to this project.
- 💬 Ask me anything about my favorite subjects or other as well, I love learning new things !
- 📫 You can reach me by putting an issue / PR or at nicolas.jeanmenne@student.uclouvain.be
